# We use compatible release functionality (see PEP 440 here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#compatible-release)
# to specify acceptable version ranges of our project dependencies. This gives us the flexibility to keep up with small
# updates/fixes, whilst ensuring we don't install a major update which could introduce backwards incompatible changes.

# We will explain this in the course
# Package the all ML model folder built in the tid_classification_model.
# Put tid_classification_model in the requirements.txt, and you don't need to embaded all ML model folder built in the api folder. 
# This manipulation will help us also to add new ML model version to the API with adding the new tid_classification_model in the requirements.txt
