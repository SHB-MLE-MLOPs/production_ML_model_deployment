# Tox is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool. Its goal is to
# standardize testing in Python. We will be using it extensively in this course.

# Using Tox we can (on multiple operating systems):
# + Eliminate PYTHONPATH challenges when running scripts/tests
# + Eliminate virtualenv setup confusion
# + Streamline steps such as model training, model publishing

## The commands to be called for testing
## This commands are typically used as part of a build system, continuous integration (CI), or test automation process. 
## It's include in this file to automate code linting, code formatting, and type checking as part of a development workflow or a CI/CD pipeline.
# flake8 is a Python tool for linting Python code (in both the classification_model and tests directories here) to check for style and programming errors.
# isort is a Python tool for sorting Python import statements within your code (in both the classification_model and tests directories here) to follow a consistent style.  It ensures that your imports are organized consistently.
# {posargs:mypy classification_model} is a command that appears to be related to type checking with MyPy, a type checker for Python. {posargs} is used to allow passing additional arguments when running the command
